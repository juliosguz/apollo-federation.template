# TS project template

## Hey! ðŸ¤“
You could use this ts project template to start your next backend project. If you find something wrong, please send your PR.

## How to use?
- Install packages with `yarn install`.
- Start the local environment with `yarn dev`.
- Run all tests created with `yarn test`.
- Create the build with `yarn build`. Check the directory `build` for the `bundle.js` file.

## WIP
- Add hygen templates.
